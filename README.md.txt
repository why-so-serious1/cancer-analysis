Nowadays, Breast Cancer is a very complex and a common problem among Females..
It is generally caused by harmful chemicals, pollution, radiations, obesity and gene mutation. 
According to the stats, every 4th minute, a women is diagnosed with breast cancer and and every 8th minute a women is dying with breast cancer.
And also there are 3 stages of breast cancer Ist, 2nd and 3rd.
At 3rd stage, generally the person dies,while at 2nd stage, the case gets out of hands and it all depends on miracles.
But it is Curable at the Ist stage. 

In order to overcome this, dangerous problem, we are developing this project-Carcinomalyze which basically detects whether a person is suffering from breast cancer or not and if yes, then the person is at which stage. 
This will help us to predict cancer at the first stage itself, and therefore will help the user to get it cured at earliest and therefore survive the life to its fullest. 
In this project we are giving a data of chromosomes in a bedpe file and the genomes' data in the csv file, and we get the required predictions in output
